Newsletters are a form of email marketing which has the highest ROI of all marketing channels. According to the research (source below), for every dollar spent you can get a return of $36 to $40.

However, to take advantage of this, understanding how your audience resonates with your content plays a crucial role.

Smart writers acknowledge that if they are not aware of what their readers think about their newsletter content, they are not going to convert: a futile effort. Well, that‚Äôs where Formbricks comes in.

After reading this article, you will have the tools they need to easily measure the quality of their content. We will further explore how you can leverage the Formbricks platform to gauge readers‚Äô engagement and satisfaction with your newsletters.

## What Is Formbricks?

Formbricks is an experience management suite built on the largest open source survey stack worldwide. It‚Äôs easy to use and integrates with any web or desktop application.

If you are sending content through newsletters, Formbricks bridges the gap between you and your readers. It packs everything you need to measure how happy users are with your newsletter content.

Read on to see how Formbricks helps you measure the quality of your newsletter content.

## How To Measure Your Newsletter‚Äôs Quality With Formbricks

Ideally, to effectively measure the quality of your newsletter, you need:

- **Survey Embed:** To embed the survey into your email so it‚Äôs part of the newsletter.
- **Link Prefilling**: So that if a reader clicks on one of the stars or smileys in your rating survey, the data is stored and the first question is skipped (more on this later).
- **Dynamic user identification:** You can append the email of the reader dynamically to the survey to automatically create a personal profile for the reader. Hence, if this person provides any other feedback, it is gathered in the person's view.

Utilizing Formbricks, you don‚Äôt have to do all this by yourself. Starting in the next section, we‚Äôll see how Formbricks streamlines these features for you.

### How To Create And Embed Surveys Seamlessly In Your Newsletter With Formbricks

In these five steps, we will see how this can be achieved easily with Formbicks.

1. After signing up on the Formbricks platform, you‚Äôll be navigated to your dashboard. To create a survey for your newsletter, select the **Growth** filter and choose the ‚Äú**Improve Newsletter Content**‚Äù survey template.

2. You‚Äôll be directed to a page that will be your canvas for customizing your survey questions. For your survey‚Äôs first question, you can display smileys, stars, or even numbers for your survey rating; in the image below, we used a smiley. You also have the flexibility to implement logic jumps for each survey question.

3. When you are done customizing your survey questions, navigate to the **Settings** tab and choose the type of survey you want - whether a link survey or an in-app survey. Ideally, you should pick a link survey.

4. After configuring the survey settings however you like, click the **Publish** button on the top right corner of the page, and a modal should pop up once this is successful.

Since you would traditionally want to embed this survey in your email, select the **Embed Survey** card. You will be directed to another modal, where the first embed option displayed will be to embed the survey in an email.

5. Finally, click the button with the ‚Äú**View Embed Code**‚Äù text at the top right corner of the modal and simply copy the HTML code for your survey anywhere you want it in your newsletter. You can see the preview in the above image.

So, how does this work under the hood? In the next section, we‚Äôll see how Formbricks utilizes data prefilling technology to create personalized responses for you.

### Personalized Responses: How Data Prefilling Works For You

As your readers answer your survey, Formbricks uses the [data prefilling](https://formbricks.com/docs/link-surveys/data-prefilling) technology to prefill each of your users‚Äô responses.

For example, if a reader named Johannes with the email address [johannes@formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/s/clrgp68g2569g1225h3f5ayql?rating=5&userId=johannes@formbricks.com) gives your newsletter a rating of 5, he will be navigated to a special URL where he will be prompted to continue the other questions in the survey. The URL will look like this:

[https://app.formbricks.com/s/clrgp68g2569g1225h3f5ayql?rating=5&userId=johannes@formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/s/clrgp68g2569g1225h3f5ayql?rating=5&userId=johannes@formbricks.com)

As you can see, the rating Johannes gave your survey has been prefilled in the URL along with his email address.

In your dashboard on Formbricks, here‚Äôs how it will look:

/>


From the image above, it neatly organizes this information. As Johannes completes the survey, you'll see a personalized, full response from him.

Also, depending on how technical you want to get, for each newsletter, you can create a new survey via the API. It's a clever way to get feedback tailored to each reader's experience.

## In Conclusion

Understanding what resonates with your readers is the compass that points toward growth, and so far, we‚Äôve seen how Formbricks can help you achieve this. Formbricks not only provides actionable insights but also serves as a bridge, closing the gap between your content and reader satisfaction.

Formbricks is free and easy to get started with. All you have to do is [create an account](http://formbricks.com/) and you are good to go üöÄ
